# Chapter 2.5 - Counting with Restrictions
## Selected Problems
**Problem 2.5.2** The Happy Valley Kennel has 4 chickens, 2 dogs, and 5 cats. (Some people in Happy Valley like to keep chickens as pets!) In how many ways can the 11 animals be placed in a row of 11 cages, such that all of the animals of each type are in adjacent cages?  

**My solution** Let us first consider the 4 chickens, 2 dogs and 5 cats as 3 different units, in which I will denote them as "H", "D" and "A" respectively. There are $3!=6$ ways to arrange the units. In the unit "H", there are $4!$ ways to arrange the chickens. In the unit "D", there are $2!$ ways to arrange the dogs. And in the unit "A", there are $5!$ ways to arrange the cats. Multiplying all of them together, we have $3!\cdot4!\cdot2!\cdot5!=34560$ ways.

**Problem 2.5.3** The Jones family has 5 boys and 3 girls, and 2 of the girls are twins. In how many ways can they be seated in a row of 8 chairs if the twins insist on sitting together, and their other sister refuses to sit next to either of her sisters?  

**Problem 2.5.5(c)** Our club has 25 members, and wishes to pick a president, secretary, and treasurer. In how many ways can we choose the officers, if individual members are allowed to hold 2, but not all 3, offices?
